This is my second project in the series of learning Data Science.
In this project, I have built a movie recommendation system using Python and pandas. 
I learned this from the Dataquest youtube channel.
The tutor was really brilliant.
Lets see what's next in the series of learning.
I have plan to implement some good personal level projects using python related to recommendation system, which I will be uploading after completing my 5th semester as the project is in my minor.
Feeling Happy to explore more.
